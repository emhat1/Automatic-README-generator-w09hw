# Automated README file generator

  ## Description
  Best practice when creating open-source projects is to include a detailed README file that describes the purpose of the app, installation requirements and instructions, Usage guidelines, information on contributions, license informtion and other contact information.  
  
  This is an automated README.md file generator designed to streamline the process.
